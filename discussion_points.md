Separate code, data, results
4. Improve the repository
(optional) implement version control on the directory and track the changes you make
add documentation
(optional) convert analysis/documentation into a markdown (or Rmarkdown) document
include metadata
update the analysis

what are some considerations for the code, analysis, and data?
Pause for discussion
