This file covers many of the discussion points from the workshop:

## 2. Investigate the contents of the files
Do the files match the contents of the analysis?
What are some of the problems you came across?
Pause for discussion

## 3. Organise the contents into a "tidy" project structure
Separate code, data, results

## 4. Improve the repository
(optional) implement version control on the directory and track the changes you make
add documentation
(optional) convert analysis/documentation into a markdown (or Rmarkdown) document
include metadata
update the analysis

# 5. Think about how you could make this analysis and data shareable

- what are some considerations for the code, analysis, and data?

The overarching consideration is who are other stakeholders/communities that need to be consulted before anything is shared
- chances are very high that someone else needs to be part of the conversation - especially indigenous communities.

Code:
- who wrote the code -> IP considerations
  - insititution policies for IP ownership -> students and staff treated differently 
- is the code commercially sensitive?
- version control platforms e.g. github, bitbucket, gitlab etc.
  - should the repository be public or private?


Analysis:
- commercial sensitivity considerations
- making sure that communities are kept in the loop and updated

Data:

Three main principles ownership, where can the data be stored, and size.

- Who owns/controls the data - make sure that indigenous communities are involved up front!
- what geographical restrictions are there for where the data is physically stored?
  - does it need to remain in country?
    - NeSI/GA data repository is a good default
    - cloud based storage: dropbox, aws, onedrive, azure, catalyst, etc.- > **where will the data be physically hosted?**
- size of data will determine what methods of data sharing will be appropriate
  - github might be appropriate for small scale e.g. < 100 MB
- consult with institution librarians (if available)
