The dataset that will be used for the workshop is originally from the differential expression section of the GA RNAseq workshop

```{r}
download.file(url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GenomicsAotearoa/RNA-seq-workshop/master/4.Differential_Expression/yeast_counts_all_chr.txt", destfile = "yeast_counts_all_chr.txt")
```

The script contents that form part of the analysis come from that workshop too.

The `analysis_doc.Rmd` rmarkdown will create the "old" version of the word document with the older figure used.
