```{r}

```


The dataset that will be used for the workshop is originally from the differential expression section of the GA RNAseq workshop

```{r download_data}
download.file(url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GenomicsAotearoa/RNA-seq-workshop/master/4.Differential_Expression/yeast_counts_all_chr.txt", destfile = here("zip/yeast_counts_all_chr.txt"))
```

The script contents that form part of the analysis come from that workshop too.

The `analysis_doc.Rmd` rmarkdown will create the "old" version of the word document with the older figure used.

```{r do_analysis, include = FALSE}
rmarkdown::render(input = here("code/analysis_doc.Rmd"), output_format = "word_document", output_file = here("zip/analysis_doc.docx"))
```
