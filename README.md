# Tidy projects

This repository is a placeholder for a workshop/tutorial were attendees play the part of "new research group members", who receive a zip file for a former project/lab team member, and are needing to use this information to start working in their new role.

The zip file contains:

- data
- script(s) (maybe a .R file)
- results derived from using the script
- a Word document containing some kind of report/commentary 
- some notes relating to the data that have been used

Workshop participants will need to:

 - download the zip file (have it on FigShare?)
 - organise the contents into a "tidy" project structure
    - separate code, data, results
    - add documentation
    - include metadata
    - turn R script into Rmd file and produce output
 - put data set on FigShare
